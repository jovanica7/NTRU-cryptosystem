# NTRU-cryptosystem
This is the implementation of the NTRU cryptosystem, via cyclic matrices as it was proposed in "Daniele Micciancio and Oded Regev. Lattice-based cryptography. In Post-quantum cryptography, pages 147â€“191. Springer, 2009." Message coding somewhat complied standard IEEE P1363.1 which can be found on the page "http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1363/lattPK/". It was a part of my master's thesis. Messages are in Serbian language.
